# Memetic Algorithm in MATLAB

This repository provides a MATLAB implementation of a **Memetic Algorithm (MA)**, a hybrid optimization technique that combines an evolutionary algorithm with a local search method. Memetic algorithms are inspired by the concept of memes, which represent units of cultural evolution, and they are particularly effective for solving complex optimization problems.

## **What is a Memetic Algorithm?**

A memetic algorithm is a population-based optimization method that integrates **global search** (using evolutionary algorithms) with **local search** (using refinement techniques). The key idea is to balance exploration (searching the entire solution space) and exploitation (refining promising solutions). This combination makes memetic algorithms highly efficient for solving challenging optimization problems.

### Key Components:
1. **Population-Based Search**: A set of candidate solutions evolves over generations using genetic operators like selection, crossover, and mutation.
2. **Local Search**: Individual solutions are refined using local optimization techniques (e.g., hill climbing, gradient descent).
3. **Cultural Evolution**: Solutions improve not only through genetic evolution but also through learning or adaptation.

### Applications:
- **Engineering Design**: Optimizing structures, parameters, and systems.
- **Combinatorial Optimization**: Solving problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) or job scheduling.
- **Machine Learning**: Hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.
- **Bioinformatics**: Protein folding, sequence alignment, and genetic analysis.
